## Wikipedia_Scrapper
My wikipedia scrapper project while studying in Becode.

## Description
In this project I query an API for a list of countries and their past leaders. Then I extract and sanitize their short bio from Wikipedia. Finally, I saved the data as a json file to the disk.
The skills I demonstrated in this project:
- Working with APIs
- Scraping
- Regular expression
- File Handling

## Installation
<ul>
<li>Command Prompt / Windows PowerShell</li>
<li>Python 3.11</li>
<li>Python Packages: Requests, bs4</li>
</ul>

## How to run 
The scrapper starts by running <code>python main.py</code> in the terminal.

## Time line
This project took me 2 days to finish.

## Final result
The screenshot below shows the final result of the info I scrapped from wikipedia.
